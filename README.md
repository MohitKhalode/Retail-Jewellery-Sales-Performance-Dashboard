# Retail-Jewellery-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
 I successfully completed the Retail Jewellery Sales Performance Dashboard â€” a comprehensive project built to analyze sales, customer behavior, and performance insights for a jewelry retail business.
This dashboard tracks:
 âœ¨ Total Sales & Revenue Trends
 ðŸ“Š Branch and Executive Performance
 ðŸ’° Product-wise Profitability
 ðŸ’Ž Customer Purchase Patterns
 ðŸ“† Time-based Sales Insights
It was an amazing learning experience applying Power BI, Excel, and data visualization techniques to turn raw data into valuable business insights.
Feeling more confident in my journey toward becoming a skilled Data Analyst â€” and grateful for every dataset that helps me learn better each day! ðŸ™Œ
